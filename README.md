# TPS Starfox Lylat Wars

This project is a take at a Rail Shooter Game.
Our goal was to make a game for Android devices, using Unreal Engine.

It is recommended to play the game on an Android phone, since it was made to be used with gyroscopic controls
A joystick is still available in the game UI, and PC players may use the WASD key to move.

## /!\ Warning /!\

Curently the Windows build has a problem where the game automatically capture the cursor at launch, preventing the player to clic the start or quit button.
To avoid this, press the Win key and click on the start button. The level should launch, and the cursor will now be free.

# Inputs 

	Android :
	
	Use either gyro or the joystick to move the player.
	The top right button will recenter the gyro
	The button with a star will launch a bomb
	The down right button will make the player dash.
	Touching anywhere on the screen outside of a button will make the player shoot.
	You can do a barrel roll by dragging to the right or left.
	Using the back button will pause the game.
	
	Windows:
	
	Same as android, exept that touch controls are made with the mouse.
	There is also keyboard shortcuts:
	WASD to move
	SPACE to dash
	P to pause the game
	F to fire
