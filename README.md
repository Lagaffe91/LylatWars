Ray-shooter game made with Unreal Engine 4.21.

The main goal of this project was to make a Unreal Engine game for Android devices.

It is recommended to play the game on an Android phone since it was made to be used with gyroscopic controls.

But a joystick option is available in the game UI, and PC players may want to use WASD keys to move.

## /!\ Warning /!\

Currently the Windows build has a problem where the game automatically captures the cursor at launch, preventing the player to click the start or quit button.

To avoid this, press the Win key and click on the start button. The level should launch, and the cursor will now be free.
